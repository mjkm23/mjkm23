### 👩‍💻 About Me

- 👩‍🚀 Hi, my name is Melissa Mitchell. I'm early in my journey of transitioning to data analytics, & possibly data science, as a career. My background is mainly retail & security. I am currently studying Python & basic data analysis, while brushing up on my old math, statistics, & Excel skills. 🧮

- 💻 This past summer I participated in Revature's PEP software development training program where I learned a lot about object oriented programming, back end development, as well as some Java & SQL. I had been interested in data science before that, however. After the program, I felt that it gave me a good foundation, & I'm really thankful for the Java & SQL knowledge I gained. But I felt more certain that my interests & natural strengths made data science a better fit for me. I intend to debug my Java final project so that it passes all the tests. It was a REST API that used a DAO design pattern for database connectivity. But for now I'm focused on moving forward with my Python & data analytics studies, & becoming more acquainted with this community. 🏙️

- 🎈 I've had a lot of adventures, & I have plans & dreams for a lot more. I'm from Iowa. I've lived in New Jersey, Colorado, North Carolina, & Montana. In between all of those, Iowa always drew me back. Last year, I spent 5 months in the U.K., but I'm back in Iowa again. Besides pursuing a career change, I am looking forward to a lifestyle change that working in data will hopefully enable me to do, which is the ability to work remotely while traveling domestically and overseas. That's my goal, anyway. 🌺

- 🎉 I cheer for the ⚾ Boston Red Sox, the 🏈 Denver Broncos, & now the 🦁 Detroit Lions. My viewing habits include a lot of police procedurals -- from drama to comedy (NCIS, FBI, Hawaii Five-O, Psych, Brooklyn Nine-Nine) -- & a lot of science fiction (Star Trek/Wars/Gate, The Expanse, BSG, Killjoys, Dark Matter). 🖖
